### Set up an arena
1. run `/bladmin create <arena_name> <mode>`, where `mode` is `1` for Touchdown and `2` for Deathmatch
2. enter the editor via `/bladmin edit <arena_name>`
3. have fun customising it

If it's TD, you must also
1. set the two goals via `/bladmin goal [set|remove] <arena_name> <team_name>`
2. set the two waiting rooms via `/bladmin wroom [set|remove] <arena_name> <team_name>`
3. set the ball spawn point via `/bladmin ball [set|remove] <arena_name>`  

(one dayâ„¢ these 3 last steps will be included in the editor... maybe)

### Utility commands
* `/bladmin list`: list all arenas
* `/bladmin info <arena_name>`: list all the info about the specific arena
* `/bladmin testkit`: gives you the bouncer and the in-game physics, to easily test your maps. The last object in the hotbar restores your inventory and physics
